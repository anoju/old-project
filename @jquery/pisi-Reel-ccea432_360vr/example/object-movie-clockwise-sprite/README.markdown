jQuery Reel Clockwise Sprite Object Movie Example
=================================================

This is a simple 35 frames sprite object movie, but unlike the other example
featuring this formula 1 toy (object-movie-non-animated-sprite), this one has
the sprite organized and flowing in clockwise fashion. It also animates
and finishes one revolution in ± 3.3 seconds. On top of that it is configured
with maximal throw velocity.

It also showcases how HTML annotation can be configured into the picture
at specific frames with definition of range with `start` and `end`
properties, and at the same time demonstrates inline CSS styling.
