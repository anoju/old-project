<p>Mike once said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google won't last, <mark>they will fail</mark> at search and advertising as nothing will topple Yahoo.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, we now know he was wrong. Google has not failed, they excelled in search and online advertising, making them a very profitable company.</p>
