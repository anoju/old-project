jQuery Reel Sprite Panorama with Local Assets Example
=====================================================

This example is exactly the same as [panorama-sprite](../panorama-sprite/index.html)
example. The only difference is the customization of `$.reel.cdn` variable
normally pointing to a CDN server serving some additional image resources.
If you need to be completely offline and online CDN is no longer a viable
source of files, you can use this variable to supply any URL (either absolute
or relative to the page location), where you serve these assets. All files needed
in this folder are gathered for you in [`assets/`](../../assets/) folder.

See the complete source of [index.html](index.html) for full
implementation.
