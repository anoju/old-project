jQuery Reel Sprite Panorama Example
===================================

The single sprite can also be used for panoramas, not just for object movies.
As opposed to the stitching of frames together, you can even use automatic
exposure on your camera. It is build up from 32 frames compiled into a
sprite with 4 frames on the line. It also animates with speed of 0.1 Hz
(makes one full revolution in 10 seconds).


Options Employed In This Example
--------------------------------

- [frames](http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#frames)
- [footage](http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#footage)
- [speed](http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#speed)

See the complete source of [index.html](index.html) for full
implementation.
