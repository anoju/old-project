						BERLIN, GERMANY – Speaking at IFA 2012 in Berlin, Havis Kwon, CEO of LG Electronics Home Entertainment Company, said LG is looking forward to a sustained period of profitable growth by leveraging current technologies to their fullest potential and by creating an environment at LG where speed and innovation are viewed as being just as important to the TV business as to its mobile business.<br /><br />
						“LG is well on its way to capturing the top position in the global TV market by creating new momentum for profitable growth with an aggressive push in OLED TV and setting new benchmarks with CINEMA 3D Smart TV products,” said Mr. Kwon. “Since 2000, Korean manufacturers have maintained a leadership role in the TV market with flat panel TVs. But we can’t become complacent. The next generation of TV technologies will won’t just come from Korea and Japan, but likely from developing markets such as China.”<br /><br />

						The race for Smart TV dominance has begun. With Google’s Android OS being installed on a new device, media box or stick seemingly every month, and the threat of an enhanced Apple TV looming in the distance, most television manufacturers are looking to get their own television hardware and software finalized and into production extremely quickly.<br /><br />
						This last week in Berlin, Germany at the IFA Consumer Electronics Fair it was announced that Toshiba, LG, and Philips are bringing their combined insight to build a standardized “Smart TV Alliance” system that will allow users to watch video, play games and listen to music via the internet on their television sets.<br /><br />

						LG is thinking big. And it is launching products that are unconventionally big to beat the competition. At this year’s IFA has unveiled a new 29-inch new EA93 monitor with an attractive 21:9 aspect ratio, which promises to give us that silver screen feeling.<br /><br />
						Along with the ‘Cinema Screen’ design, the 29-inch monitor gives high-quality life-like colors provided by IPS monitor’s 100 per cent sRGB color space and 300nit brightness. The response time comes in at GTG 5ms.<br /><br />

						LG Electronics stopped short of holding an official press conference at the IFA 2012 consumer electronics trade show in Berlin this week, instead opting to show members of the press around its booth with sessions of guided media tour. This is probably because the company’s two killer products – the 55-inch 55EM970V OLED TV and the 84-inch 84LM960V 4K TV – have been making the rounds at similar events since January, and will be familiar to presser-weary journalists.<br /><br />
						Although its much-anticipated 55″ organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television has been unveiled earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, and then subsequently at a launch event in Monaco, the Korean TV manufacturer still took the opportunity to showcase the jaw-dropping display once again, as it vies for dominance in the OLED arena against cross-town rival Samsung.<br /><br />

						IFA 2012 With so many telly boxes out there, it seems likely an on-board tuner on the TV itself will become a thing of the past in the not too distant. Perhaps LG’s EA93 21:9 aspect monitor, announced at IFA, offers a clue to the shape of things to come.<br /><br />
						A 29in monitor touting a 2560 x 1080-pixel resolution it may be, but the EA93 certainly wouldn’t look out of place in studio flat or at the end of the bed, and given you can plug your phone into it if it’s MHL compliant, then the idea doesn’t seem so daft after all.<br /><br />

						LG's EA93 is a 29-inch monitor with an IPS panel. It has a 2560x1080 resolution, same as a typical movie theater screen, and a variety of connectivity options, including Dual DVI-I, HDMI, and DisplayPort. The EA93 also has a built-in USB 3.0 hub.<br /><br />

						As part of its IFA presentation, LG has shown us three new televisions and a docking speaker. Amongst the TVs is a 55-inch model that is only 4 mm thick thanks toan OLED panel, as well as an 84-inch TV based on the Ultra Definition 4K-resolution. The docking speaker for iOS and Android devices has a unique design that is reminiscent of a Rubik's cube.<br /><br />
						LG has shown the 55-inch OLED television at several conventions last year. The special thing about the OLED technology is that every single pixel emits light. The Korean manufacturer has expanded each pixel with a fourth, white subpixel, which supplements the elementary colours red, green and blue. As a result, the screen should offer a very realistic colour display, even from large viewing angles. At 4 mm, the television is extremely thin; most components are incorporated in the stand. The panel has been reinforced with carbon fiber, which results in a weight of just 7.5 kg.<br /><br />

						Slimmer than an iPhone and bigger than any other OLED TV in the world, LG today unveiled a thin new addition to its flat panel lineup at the IFA trade show in Berlin, the 55-inch 55EM9700 OLED TV that the brand promises goes “above all expectations and beyond your imagination”.<br /><br />
						Measuring just 4 millimetres thin with a similarly slim bezel, the panel is less than half the thickness of the Apple iPhone and almost disappears when viewed from the side.

						So far, Sony and Samsung have dominated IFA with a torrent of magical TVs and new phones. But LG is quietly showing off one of the coolest monitors we’ve ever seen.<br /><br />
						The Verge reports the 2560×1080 29-inch EA93 monitor boasts a highly unconventional 21:9 aspect ratio (most widescreens are 16:9). This means more screen real estate for windows aplenty, possibly sparing your desk from an additional monitor. It’d also make for a pretty fantastic Windows 8 display, giving the horizontal-heavy Metro Start Menu plenty of room to luxuriate. We wouldn’t mind perhaps a little extra resolution though. No word on pricing or availability, but expect it to cost a lot of money. <br /><br />

							<dt>LG EA93 21:9 IPS Monitor review – hands on</dt>

						It certainly isn’t the largest screen LG will be showing off on its stand at IFA this week, but the EA93 is still one of the most exciting. It’s a 21:9 IPS display that’s large enough for several full-size web browsers, word documents or spreadsheets sat side by side.<br /><br />
						The 2,560x1,080 resolution is stretched across a panel set in the same aspect ratio as a screen you’d find in your local cinema, making it ideal for watching films – assuming you can find them in the right aspect ratio, which is no easy task. LG includes a screen-splitting feature that separates the usable display into four panels, or the option to customise it to suit a specific task. Without being able to try it for ourselves we don’t know how it will affect features such as Aero Snap, but we imagine it will still come in handy for heavy multi-taskers.<br /><br />

						Do you have a wall in your home that is screaming out for an 84-inch television set? Then the LG UD 3D TV may be what you have been looking for.<br /><br />
						The LG UD 3D TV has already launched in South Korea, and now its looking to make its way to the rest of the world. Our own Todd Haselton is at IFA 2012 in Berlin and had the opportunity to take a quick look at the set for himself in the video you see above. With 8 million pixels per fram and four times the resolution (3820 x 2160) this new television may burn your retinas out if you stare at it for too long. And the set won’t just make your TV and movies look better, but also media you bring in from external sources as well such as hard drives.<br /><br />

						LG unveiled an unusual-looking computer monitor ahead of the IFA 2012 conference this week designed with multi-taskers and cinema buffs in mind. The 29-inch EA93 boasts a 21:9 aspect ratio (the same ratio used in actual movie theaters) with a native WQHD resolution of 2560 x 1080, making it an ideal choice for viewing Blu-ray flicks or gaming without the distraction of screen bezels in a multi-monitor setup.<br /><br />
						LG's framing the EA93 as a solid choice for photographers, multimedia pros and other multi-taskers as well, with a screen-splitting feature that that breaks the display up into four segments and allows several custom options. The Dual Link-up function allows two devices to connect to the monitor simultaneously.<br /><br />

						It's battle of the 4K tellies at this year's IFA 2012 trade show, as LG announced its 84-inch, 4K televisual marvel will go on sale in the UK this October.<br /><br />
						But brace yourselves - it'll come with a price tag that's about as big as the TV itself: a mere £15,000.<br /><br />
						LG was showing off a variety of hyper-coloured animated graphics that were moving in smooth motion to make the most of the 2160 x 3840 pixel resolution. To most that's better known as "4K", or 2160p, although LG has opted for the "UD" or "Ultra Definition" label instead. We're sure there'll be a more common name as more manufacturers dip into the world of 4K - indeed Sony has already used IFA 2012 as the platform for its 84-inch 4K telly launch.<br /><br />

						LG's monster 55-inch OLED television attracted a crowd of photographers when it was unveiled Thursday at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will attract a crowd of buyers when it hits stores.<br /><br />
						OLED screens are much thinner than current LCDs (liquid crystal displays) and PDPs (plasma display panels), the images are brighter and more vibrant, and they handle fast-moving images like sports better. Just about anyone who sees one wants it in their living room, but there's a problem.<br /><br />

Then good news: LG has its 84-inch Ultra-Definition 3D TV here at IFA 2012 in Berlin, and we've had some time to peer into its depths at the company's booth. In this brightly-lit environment the first thing that we noticed was the glare — the display is nearly impossible to see from the sides. Still, we wouldn't call this normal TV watching conditions, and this problem plagues many of LG's sets here.<br /><br />

						It's alive! We spotted a powered-off version of LG's latest monitor earlier in the week, but now it's loaded up with content and ready to make its formal debut. LG's gone big -- very big -- with some of the showings at its IFA booth. But in addition to the massive 84-inch UD 3D TV and the 55-inch OLED HD TV, it's also showcasing some more modest displays. The company announced its 21:9 aspect ratio monitor, the 29-inch EA93, just prior to IFA. The IPS monitor boasts a WQHD resolution (2,560 x 1,080 pixels) and supports four-way split-screen view. The wide-screen aspect ratio is the same you'll find at a movie theater, making it an ideal choice for viewing Blu-ray flicks, and LG's framing the EA93 as a choice setup for photographers and other multimedia pros, too.<br /><br />

The company's 84LM9600 was announced last week and has already started shipping in Korea, but it's here at IFA and poised to hit the market worldwide. Priced at about ,105, this display is big in every way. You get a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 -- four times the resolution of existing full HD panels -- and what LG calls "3D sound" thanks to 2.2 integrated channel speakers. 3D is courtesy of the company's passive glasses technology.

						We first saw LG's 55-inch OLED TV at last year's CES, where it drew a fair share of oohs and ahhs at the company's press event. In May, the tentative pricing info for the European market was released, but this set's future in the US remained TBD. Fast forward to IFA 2012, and we're in front of this giant again -- but this time, it's sporting 3D. True, at 55 inches, it's no goliath compared to the 84-inch TVs we've seen this week from Sony, Toshiba and even LG, but the company claims this 55-inch model is the largest OLED HDTV available, and its carbon fiber backing and ultra-thin 4mm profile are certainly the markings of a high-end setup.<br /><br />

It has added new members outside of the manufacturing realm including hardware design companies Qualcomm and MStar, browser and application developer Obigo, advertising platform YuMe in its attempt to unify app development across various smart TV platforms. The Smart TV Alliance was first announced at IFA last year, and was officially launched in June by LG Electronics and TP Vision, and was joined shortly thereafter by Toshiba.

						LG Electronics (LG) ushered in a new era of television with the unveiling of the world’s largest and slimmest 55-inch OLED TV on European soil at Monaco’s renowned Salle des Etoiles. In front of an audience of 400 dealers, journalists and special guest F1 champion Sebastian Vettel, LG officials vowed to develop the most advanced commercial OLED TV in the market and to be the first company to bring these TVs to European consumers in the second half of the year.<br /><br />“In the history of television, there have been very few innovations as impactful as the coming of OLED TV,” said Havis Kwon, President and CEO of LG’s Home Entertainment Company. “We say THE ULTIMATE DISPLAY because LG OLED TV is truly above all expectations and beyond everyone’s imagination with uncompromising picture quality and beautiful design. This year, we plan to make OLED synonymous with LG.”See More…

						If you’re a gadget enthusiast like us then the term OLED would be nothing new to you, and in fact it has been thrown around by certain TV brands for a number of years with no real products brought to market other than small TV sizes, although this has all changed recently. The most impressive and recent television featuring this technology is LG’s new 55-inch OLED TV that will release in 2012.<br /><br />Every brand has a World’s something – LG are stating that this new 55-inch television is the “World’s Largest and Slimmest OLED TV“, and the product was launched with 400 VIPs watching in Monaco. While we have not personally enjoyed the LG TVs we’ve tested in the past, having seen first hand some of their latest technology it seems display quality has really jumped up a notch. The new 55-inch OLED TV shows how far LG has come and we’re extremely impressed.<br /><br />See More…

						A short walk from the most glamorous circuit on the F1 calendar, LG finally took the wraps off its debut OLED TV, the 55EM960V.<br /><br />Shown in prototype form at CES 2012 back in January, the revolutionary screen will be available for pre-order from July, with models shipping in the autumn. It will sell for 9,000 Euros.<br /><br />To help with the Monaco unveiling, LG called upon BBC GP pundit David Coulthard and two-time F1 world champion Sebastian Vettel, as well as supermodel Gemma Sanderson and movie director Jean-Jacques Annaud.

						LG has taken the covers off its latest tellybox, which boasts phenomenal colours and superb contrast thanks to its OLED technology. It also offers a mind-bending 4mm thickness. It's up for preorder in July, but the bad news is you're going to have to lay down £8,000 if you want one. Eight thousand Pounds.<br /><br />OLED stands for Organic Light-Emitting Diodes -- it basically means each pixel is able to generate its own light, rather than needing a backlight like a normal flatscreen TV. This results in blacks that are incredibly deep, as there's no extra light making them look grey and washed-out. LG's TV therefore manages to offer a superb amount of contrast while also being extremely vivid.<br /><br />See More…

This particular unveiling happened right in front of an audience of 400 dealers, journalists and special guest F1 champion Sebastian Vettel, where LG officials has a mission statement in their career to churn out the most advanced commercial OLED TV in the market. I suppose they have done a pretty good job at it, and LG is also proud to be the first company to deliver these TVs to European consumers sometime in the second half of 2012.<br /><br />Havis Kwon, President and CEO of LG’s Home Entertainment Company, said, “In the history of television, there have been very few innovations as impactful as the coming of OLED TV. We say THE ULTIMATE DISPLAY because LG OLED TV is truly above all expectations and beyond everyone’s imagination with uncompromising picture quality and beautiful design.
